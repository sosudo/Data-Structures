# Infinte Adder
Write a program that can add 2 positive integers of ANY LENGTH (limited only by computer memory). Store the 2 integers as a linked list of digits (each node is a single digit from 0 – 9). Read each number from a  file of digits(for example, a file with “2 3 7 0 1” represents the number 23701). One file should be called “num1.txt” and the other file should be called “num2.txt”. The Hard Part: When you print out the answer, it should be in “normal” order.
